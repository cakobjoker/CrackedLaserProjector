**Cracked out Laser Projector is a DMX-controllable RGB laser projector using 3 class 4 lasers (*VERY dangerous*)**


TODO
- Pass laser power supply through a N-gate MOSFET so that the laser can only turn on via PINOUT *currently disconnecting power to the arduino will cause the laser to go to 100% power and become a ceiling engraver/eyeball eraser*
- Get glass mirrors cut to size with brackets *Test setup involved acrylic mirrors which distort the beam*
- Make a web app control interface to select basic shapes to draw
- Implement a communication protocol to convert videos into bytestreams and convert to vector data to draw
- Do it all 2 more times with red and blue lasers and draw RGB using 24bpp for full colour video
- Figure out how to make it one cohesive unit
